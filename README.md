# What are Factors that Affect Restaurant Ratings?
## A QTM100 Course Final Project

This is a final project for QTM100, in which we discovered several associations between different factors regarding Restaurant Ratings in the Zomato data set.

In this project, I collaborated with three other teammates: Katie Silver, Zoe Howard-Barr and Arin Nelson. For their contacts you may want to contact me first by emailing my school email: hzha494@emory.edu.
