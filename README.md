# What are Factors that Affect Restaurant Ratings?
## A QTM100 Course Final Project

## Introduction
This is a final project for QTM100, in which we discovered several associations between different factors regarding Restaurant Ratings in the Zomato data set. In this project. We were able to investigate three core research questions, which would be illustrated more in detail below.

## Research Question 1
Table bookings have increased in popularity, as more restaurants offer this option through a number of online reservation apps as well as calling the restaurant. Using the Zomato Restaurants dataset, our research focuses on restaurant rating text in the context of the table booking opportunity.

Across both tests we find restaurants that have higher ratings are more likely to have table booking options. This indicates that perhaps one factor that influences restaurant rating may be table booking. However, a majority of restaurants that have high ratings do not have table bookings. This may be due to other factors like locality, price range, or cuisine quality. 

Further research could be done into other factors that influence restaurant rating or why the majority of restaurants choose not to have table booking services.

## Research Question 2
A person’s opinion of their restaurant experience is intertwined with a number of factors, such as pricing. Restaurants greatly vary in pricing, from cheap fast food meals to expensive high dining meals. Using the Zomato Restaurants dataset, our research focuses on restaurant aggregate rating in the context of price range.

Across both tests we find restaurants that have higher ratings are more likely to have higher price ranges. This indicates that perhaps one factor that influences restaurant rating may be the price range of that restaurant. However, restaurants that have high ratings do not all have high price ranges. This may mean rating is due to a mix of other factors like location, cuisine type, publicity, etc. . 

Further research could be done into other factors that influence restaurant rating or why some restaurants with low price ranges are able to achieve high ratings. 

## Research Question 3
Many people, after visiting a restaurant, turn to online platforms such as Google review and Yelp to rate their experience. The number of responses vary from restaurant to restaurant, with some having few votes while others have much more. Using the Zomato Restaurants dataset, our research focuses on restaurant ratings in the context of the number of votes a restaurant receives. 

The results from our linear regression test indicate that there is evidence that the correlation between the number of votes a restaurant receives and its aggregate rating are not equal to zero. This result may indicate that an increase in votes leads to an increase in rating. 

This may mean restaurants try to encourage patrons to vote on the restaurant in hopes of increases its overall rating. 

## Discussion
Our results look at how restaurants are perceived by the public by looking at restaurant price, rating, and the number of votes a restaurant received. We explored how these factors were interconnected and found statistically that there are intrinsic relationships between them.

If we were to re-explore this topic, perhaps a more extensive sample size or more time to delve deeper into the facets of our data set would have allowed us to pull more conclusions. We could have explored cuisine type and location as factors that influence the ways in which a restaurant is regarded. Perhaps it would be possible to statistically discern what makes up a quality restaurant.
